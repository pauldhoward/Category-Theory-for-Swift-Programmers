# Category Theory for Swift Programmers

A Playground containing Swift code samples for [Bartosz Milewski](http://bartoszmilewski.com)'s book [Category Theory for Programmers](http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)

I'm updating this repository as I'm reading through the book, converting the Haskell and C++ code to Swift where possible.
